## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a popular game where two players take turns to place their markers (either X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who places three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all boxes are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

This implementation provides a basic version of Tic Tac Toe that runs in a web browser. It includes functionality for starting a new game, resetting the game, and displaying game results.

## Features

- **Interactive Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players can click to place their markers.
- **Player Turn Management**: The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: Announces when the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Provides options to start a new game or reset the current game.
